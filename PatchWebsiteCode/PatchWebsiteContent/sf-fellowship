# SF Fellowship

**A short, high-intensity immersion in San Francisco for exceptional young Irish builders.**

The Patch SF Fellowship brings a small group of outstanding young people to San Francisco for around 10 days. It’s not an open-application programme — it’s something we run selectively for people we believe will benefit most.

The goal is simple: **accelerate some of Ireland’s most talented youth and raise their aspirations** by placing them inside one of the world’s most ambitious technology ecosystems.

## What it looks like

We recently ran the Fellowship for a second time, bringing **12 engineers from Ireland** to San Francisco.

Over the course of the trip, Fellows:
- Meet founders, engineers, researchers, and operators working on ambitious companies  
- Spend time inside leading technology organisations  
- Arrange their own meetings through cold outreach and curiosity  
- Follow interests wherever they lead — software, hardware, robotics, AI, biotech, and more  

There’s no rigid curriculum. The Fellowship combines a strong core schedule with room for Fellows to explore independently.

## Who Fellows meet

Fellows receive a warm introduction to San Francisco through a mix of formal visits and informal conversations.

Recent hosts and meetings included:
- Patrick Collison at Stripe  
- Sarah Friar and the team at OpenAI  
- Conversations at Y Combinator  
- Irish founders building in SF at companies like Solidroad, Forge Robotics, and Ulysses 

Many people also help behind the scenes — hosting Fellows, inviting them to events, introducing friends, or simply taking the time to talk.
