# Patch Grants

**Quick grants of €200–€1,000 for young builders in Ireland — go build.**

Patch Grants support young builders in Ireland (ages **13–19**) with fast, flexible funding to help you take action and learn by doing.

Whether you want to:

- Build a prototype or hardware project  
- Run a small community event or workshop  
- Travel to a conference or learning opportunity  
- Explore an idea you can’t shake  

…we’ll fund anything that meaningfully helps you learn by building real things.

## How it works

- **Grant size:** €200–€1,000  
- **Turnaround:** ~1 week  
- **Process:** Short form → 15–30 min call → decision  

These grants are designed to help early builders get started fast — before you have a network, track record, or budget. Even small projects can unlock confidence, skills, and a lifelong builder identity.
